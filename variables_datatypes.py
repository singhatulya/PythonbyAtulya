#This code will show to use Variables and different ways of storing data(string, integer, float) in Python.
#--Variables--
#Variables can be used to store any data. Think of it like a box!

name = "Atulya Singh"
print(name)

number = 3
print(number)

pi = 3.14159
print(pi)

#Now we can manipulate these variables to make computers do anything using these variables.

print("My name is", name) #We don't need to define it now. We have already defined it in line 5.
r = 3 #Define radius
print(pi * r * r)   #The * is used for multiplication. This code will find the area of the circle radius r.

#--Data Types--
#There are three ways we can define data into. Whether it's a string, integer or a float.
#String data can be used to store letters, words, number and even symbols.

name = str("Atulya Singh!") #We use str for string data
print("My name is", name)

#Integer data can be used to store integer numbers which could be negative, zero or positive.

students = int(3)
print("Number of students in class is", students)

#Float amount can be used to store decimal values.

pi = float(3.14159)
print("Value of pi is", pi)
